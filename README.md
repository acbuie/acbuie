I'm currently a GIS Technician at Utah State University's Remote Sensing/GIS Lab. I graduated from North Carolina - Chapel Hill in 2019, studying geology and environmental science. I'm interested in the intersection of remote sensing, planetary science, and programming, especially relating to image classifcation and analysis. 

I'm mostly a self taught programmer, with a little academic background, so hopefully my page will fill up as I continue to learn.

Here are some things I'm learning about: 
- Command Line Interfaces
- Software design, architecture, and testing
- Machine learning, especially related to remote sensing and image analysis
- Python packaging tools
